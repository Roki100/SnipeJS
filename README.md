## Configuration

To be able to snipe a name, you must enter your credentials and bearer token into the config.json file. It should look something like this:

```json
{
    "username": "",
    "password": "",
    "bearer": "",
    "questions": ["", "", ""]
}
```

You can obtain the bearer token by logging in to minecraft.net and using [EditThisCookie](http://www.editthiscookie.com) to find the bearer token. Note that the token will quickly expire and an alternative method to obtaining token is being explored.
